			<h2>About us</h2>
				<p>
				The idea with our product is to create a healthy French candy that consumers would enjoy eating and not regret having eaten or having let their children eat it. As healthy and organic markets thrive in France, so does the French and local market. Taking these two factors into account, our product would be a pleasure that is good for your health and that you can eat whenever you desire, during a break or a snacktime. 
				We even go further by saying that eating our product gives you essential vitamins and other fruit specificities that you need on a daily basis. As said previously, both children and their parents will eat it because the “candy is disastrous for your health” barrier is broken.
